# Installing Apps

You're most likely used to the App Store or Play Store if you're coming from iOS or Android. You might have
also used a different store if your device comes equipped with it (Galaxy Store, Huawei Store, etc.).

With SailfishOS there are multiple stores available: the official **Jolla Store**, the community **Storeman**
and **Chum** stores, and if you have an official device with [Android App Support](../android/index.md) there's
also **F-Droid** and **Aurora Store** (a Play Store replacement).

Let's take a brief look at each of them!

## Jolla Store

The official store by the creators of SailfishOS, Jolla. They vet every app in there to make sure nothing
malicious happens. This is equivalent to the App Store on iOS and Play Store on Android.

[See the dedicated Jolla Store page for more info.](jolla-store.md)

## Storeman & Chum

Both are community stores where developers themselves can publish whatever they want. This means there
are no restrictions on what's published, so even advanced, OS modifying stuff not allowed in the
[Jolla Store](jolla-store.md) can be published there, on the other hand **no one checks whether the apps are safe
to install**.

So if someone wanted to hide malware in an app published in the official Jolla store, they'd have to be
very smart and hide it very well. In Storeman and Chum, on the other hand, they can freely publish it and until
someone actually notices it, it can be installed everywhere.

With that in mind, don't worry - the stores **are not full of malware**, the point is that installing from
them makes it your fault if your device breaks.

> If you're wondering why these exist in the first place, it's mainly because Jolla Store rules are very strict,

> system, thus limiting how awesome they can be.

## F-Droid

> If you don't have a way to run Android apps on your SailfishOS device, this store won't work.

This is a known and trusted app store with **open source** apps. You might have come across it if you've used
Android before.

The apps from there are checked by volunteers before being published, but don't expect any in-depth reviews,
so while obvious malware probably won't fly, this is more dangerous than the [Jolla Store](jolla-store.md).

The advantage over the [Aurora Store](aurora.md) is that all apps are open source and very often work well
even in environments which don't assume they're running on a Google-certified Android device - this makes
them generally better suited for SailfishOS than a random app from the Play Store.

[See the dedicated F-Droid page for more info (including how to install it).](f-droid.md)

## Aurora Store

> If you don't have a way to run Android apps on your SailfishOS device, this store won't work.

[Aurora Store](aurora.md) is an alternative way for accessing the Play Store. Every application from
the Play Store can be installed from there. If you don't have a Google account you can either create one
or let the store generate one for you, being as anonymous as one can when downloading from Google's servers.

If you have any purchased apps on Google Play already, you can download them from [Aurora Store](aurora.md)
if you log in through your own account.
