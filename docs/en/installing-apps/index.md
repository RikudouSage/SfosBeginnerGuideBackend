title: Installing Apps
---

If you're coming from iOS or Android you're probably used to the App Store or Play Store. You might also
have used another vendor store that ships with your device (Galaxy Store, Huawei Store, etc.).

SailfishOS offers multiple stores: the official **Jolla Store**, the community **Storeman**
and **Chum** stores, and on official devices with [Android App Support](../android/index.md) also **F-Droid**
and **Aurora Store** (a Play Store replacement).

Let's take a brief look at each of them!

## TL;DR

If you don't want to read the descriptions, here's a TL;DR:

- [Jolla Store](jolla-store.md) – the official SailfishOS store
- [Chum](chum.md) & [Storeman](storeman.md) – unofficial community stores, might contain unsafe apps
- [F-Droid](f-droid.md) - open source store for Android apps
- [Aurora](aurora.md) – third-party Google Play client allowing you to install any Play Store apps

## Jolla Store

The official store from the makers of SailfishOS, Jolla. Every app is reviewed to make sure nothing
malicious slips through. Think of it as the App Store on iOS or the Play Store on Android.

[See the dedicated Jolla Store page for more info.](jolla-store.md)

## Storeman & Chum

Both are community stores where developers publish directly. There are no publication restrictions, so
advanced, OS-modifying tools that are not allowed in the [Jolla Store](jolla-store.md) can be posted there.
The flip side is that **no one checks whether the apps are safe to install**.

If someone wanted to hide malware in the official Jolla Store, they'd need to disguise it extremely well.
In Storeman or Chum they could publish it freely and, until someone spots it, it would stay available.

That said, these stores **are not packed with malware**; the point is that if something breaks after you
install from them, the responsibility is yours.

> If you're wondering why these exist in the first place, it's mainly because Jolla Store rules are very strict,
> some might say unnecessarily so. Apps in there are allowed to touch a very limited set of the operating
> system, thus limiting how awesome they can be.

## F-Droid

> If you don't have a way to run Android apps on your SailfishOS device, this store won't work.

This is a well-known and trusted app store for **open source** apps. You might have seen it before if you've
used Android.

Apps are reviewed by volunteers before publication, but don't expect deep code audits, so while obvious
malware likely won't pass, it's still riskier than the [Jolla Store](jolla-store.md).

Compared with the [Aurora Store](aurora.md), every app is open source and *often* works well even without a
Google-certified Android environment. That usually makes them better suited to SailfishOS than random apps
from the Play Store.

## Aurora Store

> If you don't have a way to run Android apps on your SailfishOS device, this store won't work.

[Aurora Store](aurora.md) is an alternative way to access the Play Store. Every Play Store app can be installed
through it. If you don't have a Google account you can create one or let the store generate one for you, staying
as anonymous as possible when downloading from Google's servers.

If you already own paid apps on Google Play, you can download them via [Aurora Store](aurora.md) by signing in
with your own account.
