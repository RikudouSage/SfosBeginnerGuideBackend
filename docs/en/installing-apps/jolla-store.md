The [Jolla Store](start-app://store-client) is the official app store by Jolla. You find an app, click
install, and you're done – exactly like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

## Installation

It's already installed!

## Security

All apps have to follow **extremely** strict rules for what can be included in them, and each app and every update
is reviewed by Jolla employees.

> The strict rules are sadly way too extreme, and many useful apps simply cannot exist in the Jolla Store.

## Usage

As already mentioned, the usage is extremely simple – [open the store](start-app://store-client), browse for apps,
and download!
