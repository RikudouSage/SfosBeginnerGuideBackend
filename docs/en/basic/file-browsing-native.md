title: Built-in file browser
---

SailfishOS has a built‑in file browser, but it’s pretty hidden and not very obvious to open.
Let’s find it anyway!

> I recommend using a different file browser for regular use. This one is fine if you only need to browse files
> *this one time*, but it’s tedious for everyday use.

### Finding the file browser

1. Open [**Settings**](start-app://jolla-settings)
2. Go to **Storage** (in the **System** section)
3. Open **User data** (the first circle)
4. Open the pull‑down menu and choose **File manager**

## Usage

This browser is very simple. You can do basic things like create folders, open files, rename files, copy and
paste, and share.

If you just need to quickly open a file or create a folder, it works fine. For anything more than that, a
full‑featured file browser will be a lot more comfortable.
