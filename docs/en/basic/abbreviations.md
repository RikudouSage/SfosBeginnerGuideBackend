As any community, we have our fair share of abbreviations – because WWTTEATT
(Who Wants To Type Everything All The Time - definitely gonna copyright this catchy abbreviation).

- `SFOS` – the one and only **S**ail**f**ish**OS** aka the system the Jolla phones run on
- `AAS` – **A**ndroid **A**pp **S**upport – aka the [Android subsystem](../android/index.md) used to run Android apps
- `TJC` – [**t**ogether.**j**olla.**c**om](https://together.jolla.com), an old forum before the current one (currently in read-only mode)
- `FSO` – [**f**orum.**s**ailfishos.**o**rg](https://forum.sailfishos.org), the current community forum, also available as an app called [SFOS Forum Viewer](start-app://harbour-sfos-forum-viewer) (available in the [Jolla Store](start-app://store-client))
