title: Sailfish Utilities
---

This is an app made by Jolla to help with some troubleshooting. To install it, go to the 
[Jolla Store](store-app://sailfish-utilities) (if the link doesn't work, search for "Sailfish Utilities.").

Afterwards, open [Settings](start-app://jolla-settings) and scroll all the way down to the **Info**
section, which now has an additional entry called **Utilities**.

Inside it are buttons to restart various things, at the time of writing:

- **Network** – use if you have trouble with Wi-Fi or mobile data
- **Keyboard** – self-explanatory, might fix your keyboard issues
- **Home screen** – this not only restarts the homescreen, but also kills all running apps
- **Fingerprint** – can't unlock your phone with fingerprint? Try this!
- **Audio** – again really self-explanatory, might just fix your audio issues
- **Bluetooth** – not scanning or not connecting? Try restarting!
- **Package cache** – if apps from a store don't install, clearing this cache might help
- **Tracker database** – if any images, audio or video are missing even though you're sure they exist, this will help
