There are many apps and the awesome community keeps creating more! Here we'll list some of the alternatives
for popular Android/iOS apps. Of course, if you have [Android support](../android/index.md), you may
also install the original.

> Fair warning: The SailfishOS community likes their fish! A lot of the native app's names reference
> sailing or fish, so hopefully you won't get seasick!
