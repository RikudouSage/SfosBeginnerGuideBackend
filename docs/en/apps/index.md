There are many apps and the awesome community keeps creating more! Here we'll list some of the alternatives
for popular Android/iOS apps. Of course, if you have [Android support](../android/index.md), you may
also install the original.

> Fair warning: The SailfishOS community likes their fish! A lot of the native app's names reference
> sailing or fish, so hopefully you won't get seasick!

## Chat apps

- **Whisperfish** [*Signal*] – a native SailfishOS client for Signal, can act as the primary device or as a secondary one
- **Molly** [*Signal*] (*Android*) – an open source fork of the official Signal app made with non-certified Android devices
  which makes it a much better fit for SailfishOS than the official Signal app
- **Yottagram** [*Telegram*] - TBD

## Social media

- **SFOS Forum** – the one and only SailfishOS Forum as an app!
- **Tooter β** [*Mastodon*] – a native Mastodon app

## Password managers

- **BitSailor** [*Bitwarden*] – a native app relying on the official Bitwarden CLI tools for connecting
  to the Bitwarden servers.
- **qmlpass** – a frontend for the native Linux `pass` manager

## Media

- **Sailfin** [*Jellyfin*] – watch your local media collection
